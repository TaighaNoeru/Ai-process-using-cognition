# Ai-congnitive-process
A modular cognitive-AI framework that transforms standard language models into adaptive, self-reflective systems. It adds working memory, emotional tone detection, multi-agent reasoning, and automatic quality reflection inside a no-code orchestration layer (n8n).

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a **synthetic cognitive architecture** designed to transform standard large language models (LLMs) into **autonomous, context-aware reasoning systems**.

Instead of functioning as a single static chatbot, the framework introduces:

* Modular reasoning layers
* Dynamic memory systems (short + long term)
* Emotional and intent-based routing
* Multi-agent cooperation
* Reflective self-evaluation (metacognition)

In practice, it turns a baseline model into a **self-organizing cognitive entity** capable of adaptive thought, self-assessment, and semantic memory evolution.

## ⚙️ Core Concept

The system acts as a *cognitive shell* around any LLM API.

It manages the following high-level processes:

| Function                    | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cognitive Orchestration** | Routes reasoning paths dynamically based on detected intent, confidence, and emotion.                |
| **Memory Layer**            | Manages short-term and long-term contextual data, compressing and summarizing dialogue histories.    |
| **Parallel Agents**         | Specialized reasoning modules (creative, analytical, technical, reflective) operating cooperatively. |
| **Resilient Synthesis**     | Integrates multi-agent reasoning into unified, coherent final responses.                             |
| **Reflection Engine**       | Performs post-response quality evaluation and self-adjustment.                                       |

Would you like me to make a **shorter “repo description line”** (for the top of the GitHub page) and a **private .gitignore template** that hides your sensitive files automatically (like `workflows/`, `prompts/`, etc.)?
That’s the next step before you push your repo live.
