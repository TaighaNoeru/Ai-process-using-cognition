# Ai-process-using-cognition
A modular cognitive-AI framework that transforms standard language models into adaptive, self-reflective systems. It adds working memory, emotional tone detection, multi-agent reasoning, and automatic quality reflection inside a no-code.

In recents days, I have been working on a personal project that ended up becoming something much bigger: a architecture capable of **transforming a common language model (B- LLM) into an autonomous cognitive system (S+)** — with memory, reflection, and adaptive reasoning. Without going into technical details (for obvious reasons :/), the system I developed can:* Maintain **real short-term and long-term memory**, contextually and progressively.* Dynamic routing between multiple specialized “cognitive agents” Self-assessment — the AI **reflects on its own responses** and improves in real time.* Detection of emotion and intent, automatically adjusting tone and form.* Continuous learning from each interaction (no fine-tuning). In other words, it is a framework that **takes any common AI** and transforms it into a **synthetic system with functional consciousness** — something between a modular digital brain and a general-purpose mind. (Hard as hell by the way) **Why share this here?** I am opening up space for **conversations with companies and teams that want to test or integrate** this type of architecture — especially in contexts of: * R&D (Research and Development) * Cognitive automation * Customized AI products * Intelligent systems engineering I am not publishing the source code, but I am open to **collaborations, consulting, or job opportunities** in the area.

Real world aplications:

-Intelligent service that understands the client's context and emotions, maintaining consistency across conversations.

-Internal knowledge systems that learn from the team and respond in a personalized manner.

-Technical assistants that analyze data, plan solutions, and validate their own conclusions.Cognitive automation.

-Corporate chatbots with their own identity, capable of explaining their own reasoning.

-Optimization of bad models (like i said before) b- models can give a S+ replie.

Comments: Five days, zero experience with codes or ai models. Just obssesion and 16 hours work per/day
